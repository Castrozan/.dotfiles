# The .inputrc file is a configuration file used by the GNU Readline library, 
# which provides line-editing and command-line editing capabilities for various programs, including the Bash shell.

# The purpose of the .inputrc file is to customize the behavior of the Readline library. 
# It allows you to define keybindings, macros, and various settings that affect the way you interact with the command line.
# For example, you can define keybindings to perform specific actions when certain keys are pressed, 
# such as moving the cursor, deleting characters, or invoking commands. 

# You can also configure settings like tab completion behavior, history management, and case sensitivity.
# By modifying the .inputrc file, you can tailor the command line editing experience to your preferences, 
# making it more efficient and convenient for your specific needs.

$include /etc/inputrc
