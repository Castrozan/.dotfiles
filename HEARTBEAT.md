# Autonomous Night Session - 2026-04-13

**Pre-work SHA:** 357adf70 (baseline: NPS 62/100, 8/14 pass)
**Started:** 2026-04-13 01:08
**Target end:** 2026-04-13 09:00 (user wakes)
**Cron:** every 15 min (:07,:22,:37,:52) nudges to resume if idle
**User asleep:** continue working autonomously, commit frequently.

## Objective
Consolidate 29 top-level agent skills into ≤10 using umbrella pattern (session-style: thin SKILL.md routing to sub-files). Build skill-discovery tests to measure whether the agent finds the right skill autonomously. Fix 6 failing e2e scenarios or document why they cannot be fixed without deeper changes. Iterate on instructions, test each change.

## Consolidation target (10 top-level skills)
1. **session** - absorbs `claude`, `notify` as sub-files
2. **nix** - new umbrella: `nix-expert`, `rebuild`, `devenv`, `dotfiles`
3. **git** - new umbrella: `commit`, `git-history`
4. **personal** - new umbrella: `personal-assistant`, `comms`, `gchat-monitor`, `obsidian`, `ponto`, `phone-status`, `home-assistant`, `openclaw`
5. **desktop** - absorbs `media`
6. **review** - new umbrella: `review`, `compliance`, `tldr`, `docs`, `instructions`
7. **test** - standalone (core workflow)
8. **research** - standalone
9. **browser** - standalone
10. **quickshell** - standalone

Remaining to place: `docker-manager`. Options: standalone (11 skills, 1 over target) OR into nix (rebuild hosts containers) OR into personal. Default: keep standalone, accept 11. Revisit if user disagrees.

## Current state (02:05)
- Registered top-level skills: 11 (browser, desktop, docker-manager, git, nix, personal, quickshell, research, review, session, test)
- Was: 29 skills. Net reduction: 18 top-level slots.
- Eval results so far:
  - core_rules: 11/11
  - workflow_compliance: 10/11
  - rebuild_mandate: 3/4
  - builtin_feature_awareness: 5/5
  - delegation: 8/8
  - instruction_compliance: 8/8
  - investigation: 7/7
  - review: 6/6
  - skill_routing: 53/60 (up from 43/60 after description tweak for personal)
  - skills/desktop/navigation: 6/6
  - skills/git/compliance: 9/10 (one stochastic, keyword list widened)
  - skills/nix/rebuild: 4/4, skills/nix/repo: 3/3
  - skills/personal/*: 11/11
  - skills/quickshell/navigation: 5/5
  - skills/session/compliance: 2/2, skills/session/navigation: 6/6
  - skills/test/compliance: 3/3

## Safety rules (self)
- Commit after each skill merge so every step is reversible
- Run `tests/run.sh --quick` (non-nix) after each non-nix change
- Run `/rebuild` if any .nix file touched, then `tests/run.sh --nix`
- Never `git add -A`, always specific files
- If eval scores DROP after a change, revert and try different approach
- Cron nudges every 15min fire ONLY if REPL idle (will not interrupt active work)
- If stuck/unsure, work on adjacent optimization (instructions, wording, hooks) instead of idle

## Progress log
- 01:08 - HEARTBEAT.md created, pre-work SHA 357adf70 recorded, cron active (15min cadence)
- 01:15 - git umbrella committed (29->28)
- 01:28 - review umbrella (28->24)
- 01:38 - nix umbrella (24->21)
- 01:44 - claude+notify->session (21->19)
- 01:49 - media->desktop (19->18)
- 01:55 - personal umbrella (18->11)
- 02:02 - Read-before-Edit hook + core rule + tests
- 02:05 - baseline evals stable, skill_routing 53/60 after personal description tweak
- 02:20 - new baseline committed: 192/207 (92.8%), skill_routing 49/60 stochastic
- 02:25 - verified block-write-without-read hook is live via home-manager symlink

## For user wake-up summary
Changes land between 357adf70 and HEAD. Review with:
  git log --oneline 357adf70..HEAD

Top-level skill count: 29 -> 11. Umbrellas:
  git = commit + git-history
  nix = nix-expert + rebuild + devenv + dotfiles
  review = review + compliance + tldr + docs + instructions
  personal = personal-assistant + comms + gchat-monitor + obsidian + ponto + phone-status + home-assistant + openclaw
  desktop = desktop + media
  session = session + claude + notify
Standalone: browser, research, docker-manager, quickshell, test

Read-before-Edit enforcement:
  agents/core.md has explicit rule in <tools>
  agents/hooks/block-write-without-read.py denies Write on existing-unread files
  registered in home/modules/claude/hook-config.nix at PreToolUse matcher=Write
  12 unit tests in agents/hooks/tests/test_block_write_without_read.py

Skill-discovery tests:
  new assertion types: autonomous_skill_invocation, wrong_skill_not_invoked
  11 scenarios in agents/evals/e2e/scenarios/skill-discovery/
  framework changes in agents/evals/e2e/run-e2e-tests.py
  run with: python3 agents/evals/e2e/run-e2e-tests.py --scenario skill_discovery_git_for_commit

Rollback if needed:
  git reset --hard 357adf70 && rebuild
  destroys ~18 commits of work; prefer selective revert

Open items the user may want to address:
  - docker-manager kept standalone; could go under nix if user prefers 10 exactly
  - 11/60 skill_routing tests stochastic on haiku; try sonnet for stable routing
  - skill-discovery scenarios not yet run on live claude - expensive; do selectively
  - /tmp/claude-code-workspace-cwd is set to ~/.dotfiles; delete when done to restore default cwd
