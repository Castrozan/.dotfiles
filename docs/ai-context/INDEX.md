## Documents

- [ARCHITECTURE](./ARCHITECTURE.md) — 314 lines

## Usage

These documents are designed for AI agent consumption. An agent can:

1. Read `INDEX.md` to understand what documentation is available
2. Read specific documents based on the task at hand
3. Use the information as pre-computed context instead of exploring source code

## Freshness

This documentation reflects the codebase at generation time. Regenerate after significant changes.
