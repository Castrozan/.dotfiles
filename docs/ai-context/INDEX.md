# AI Context — Codebase Documentation

> Auto-generated by codewiki. Do not edit manually.

## Documents

- [ARCHITECTURE](./ARCHITECTURE.md) — High-level architecture, tech stack, project structure, component map
- [MODULES](./MODULES.md) — Module index, dependency graph, skill catalog, script reference

## Usage

These documents are designed for AI agent consumption. An agent should:

1. Read `INDEX.md` to understand what documentation is available
2. Read specific documents based on the task at hand
3. Use the information as pre-computed context instead of exploring source code

## Freshness

This documentation reflects the codebase at generation time. Regenerate after significant structural changes (new modules, directory reorg, large refactors).
