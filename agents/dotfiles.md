<scripts>
Python 3.12 is the default language for scripts. Use bash only when the script is a thin wrapper gluing shell-native tools (tmux send-keys, fzf, sysctl pipelines) where Python would just be subprocess.run calls. Python scripts run via Nix - no uv, no venv, no pip.

Only scripts under 10 lines of actual logic may live inline in `.nix` files via `pkgs.writeShellScript`, `pkgs.writeText`, or similar builders. Anything longer goes to a dedicated file under the module's `scripts/` directory and is referenced by path. Long inline scripts are unreadable, unformattable, untestable, and escape from nix string interpolation rules destroys quoting. When in doubt, extract.
</scripts>

<testing>
Never present code that has not been rebuilt and tested. For .nix files, a successful rebuild IS the primary verification. Run tests/run.sh (--nix when .nix files changed, --quick otherwise).
</testing>

<workflow>
After editing any file in the dotfiles repo, execute this sequence before responding. No exceptions.
1. Format edited files
2. Stage each file with git add specific-file (never -A)
3. Commit
4. Rebuild: /rebuild for any file change in this repo
5. Run tests/run.sh
6. If rebuild or tests fail: fix and repeat from 1
7. Only after rebuild and tests pass: respond to user

The end-of-work hook runs quality review automatically. It spawns parallel reviewers for code review and compliance checking. You do not need to spawn them manually.
</workflow>
