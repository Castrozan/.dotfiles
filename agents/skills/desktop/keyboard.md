Types into whatever window is currently focused — always screenshot first to verify target. Never type secrets into unverified windows. Key names are XKB keysyms — the script normalizes common aliases (ctrl→Control_L, alt→Alt_L, super→Super_L, enter→Return, esc→Escape, backspace→BackSpace) but uncommon keys need exact XKB names. Wayland-only via wtype — will not work in X11 or headless environments. For browser typing, use the browser skill instead (more reliable, targets specific elements).
